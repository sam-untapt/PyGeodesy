A Python implementation of geodesy tools for various ellipsoidal and
spherical earth models using trigonometric and vector-based methods.

Also included are conversions to and from UTM coordinates and MGRS
and OSGR grid references, see:

An additional module provides Lambert conformal conic projections
and positions, transcribed from:

The Python code was statically checked* with PyChecker, PyFlakes,
PyCodeStyle (formerly Pep8), McCabe on Python 2.7.10 and 2.7.13
and with Flake8 on Python 3.6.0.  The tests were run with 64-bit
Python 2.6.9, 2.7.10, 2.7.13, 3.5.2 and 3.6.0, but only on MacOS
10.10 Yosemite, MacOS 10.11 El Capitan and/or MacOS 10.12.2 Sierra.
